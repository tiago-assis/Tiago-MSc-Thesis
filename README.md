# Deep Biomechanically-Guided Interpolation for Keypoint-Based Brain Shift Registration

This repository provides the implementation for interpolating and predicting biomechanically-corrected displacement fields, as described in Section 2.4 of our paper: [Deep Biomechanically-Guided Interpolation for Keypoint-Based Brain Shift Registration](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2508.13762).

The code for the synthetic ground truth generation pipeline will be made available in a future release.

\
Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. This work proposes a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations. Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms classical interpolators, reducing the mean square error while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time.

## Framework Overview
The core of our method is a deep, biomechanically guided interpolator that refines an initial displacement field.

The process to train the model was performed as follows:

  1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: We generate a large dataset of realistic, synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations based on the UPENN-GBM dataset. This simulates brain deformations caused by gravity and tissue resection.

  2. **Keypoint Extraction**: Sparse matched keypoints are simulated. Keypoints are extracted from the preoperative MRI using 3D SIFT-Rank, and their corresponding displacement vectors are retrieved from the ground-truth synthetic deformation fields.

  3. **Deep Interpolation**:

        - An initial dense displacement field is created from the sparse keypoints using a standard interpolation method (e.g., Linear or Thin Plate Spline).

        - A residual 3D U-Net takes the preoperative MRI and the initial displacement field as input.

        - The network is trained to predict a residual displacement field, which refines the initial estimate to be more physically plausible and accurate.

        - The model is trained with a voxel-wise error loss and a Jacobian-based regularization loss to encourage smooth deformations.

 \
Install dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training
To reproduce the training done in this work, you will be required to download our custom dataset [NeuriPhy](https://zenodo.org/records/15381866) (TBD) that comprises: preoperative MRI data, brain and tumor segmentations, extracted keypoints, and biomechanically simulated deformation fields.

\
You can then set up the training configuration file and run the following script:
```
python train.py --configs /your/configs.json
```

The training script is highly modular, allowing the configuration of several aspects of the pipeline. The allowed arguments for configuring the `train.py` script are described in detail here -> ![assets/config_arguments.md](assets/config_arguments.md).

## Inference with your own data!
To run a pre-trained model, please download the weights in ![checkpoints](checkpoints/).

\
Three approaches can then be taken:

**1.** You have access to an initial displacement field and want to run the model for **displacement field correction** only. This displacement must be in H5 or NPZ format.

Example script:
```
python inference.py \
  -p /path/to/preoperative/scan.nii.gz \
  -i /path/to/initial/displacement/field.h5 \
  -d cuda \
  -o /path/to/output/directory
```

\
**2.** You have access to matched keypoints and their respective sparse displacements and want the framework to (1) **interpolate** and then (2) predict a **corrected** dense displacement field.
- A text file with keypoint coordinates and displacement vectors should be provided.
  - The coordinates should be in voxel space.
  - The file should follow the format: `x, y, z, disp_x, disp_y, disp_z`
- Linear or thin plate spline interpolation modes should be chosen

Example script:
```
python inference.py \
  -p /path/to/preoperative/scan.nii.gz \
  -k /path/to/keypoints/and/displacements.csv \
  -m linear \
  -d cuda \
  -o /path/to/output/directory/
```

\
**3.** You can directly **integrate the model into your code** as an interpolation step by importing the relevant classes (see [inference.py](https://github.com/tiago-assis/Deep-Biomechanical-Interpolator/blob/98ddf63f312ff566c580280626d2f248cba2faa9/inference.py#L106)) and feeding the model a concatenated (4,D,H,W) tensor, including the normalized preoperative ceT1 MRI (1,D,H,W) and initial displacement vector field (3,D,H,W).
