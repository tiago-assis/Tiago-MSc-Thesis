# Physics-Guided Deep Learning for Sparse Data-Driven Brain Shift Registration
###### **WORK IN PROGRESS... (the structure will change throughout the project to maintain each main section contained and well organized)**

This repository contains the implementation of the work done throughout my MSc thesis. 

The project explores the integration of physics-based modeling as supervision for a deep learning model that addresses the challenges of brain shift registration by interpolating sparse intraoperative data. This work aims to improve the efficiency and applicability of intraoperative brain shift predictions, which are essential in image-guided neurosurgery. 

The repository includes all the necessary code and instructions to reproduce the results and experiments discussed in the thesis.

##### The [2_biomechanical_simulations](2_biomechanical_simulations/) directory of this repository includes code adapted and optimized by me but that was originally authored by the [Intelligent Systems for Medicine Laboratory](https://isml.ecm.uwa.edu.au/ISML/index.php?title=ISML_Main_Page), The University of Western Australia, which was used in the work described in the following main publications: [1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2019.06.004), [2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cnm.3539), [3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105271), [4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11548-023-02881-7).

## Installation
The code was mostly tested with [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/) in an [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) system (either natively or through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)), thus this is the recommended environment to use when running any code in this repository.

This project utilizes very different codebases, including [SynthSeg](https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg), [ExplicitSim](https://bitbucket.org/explicitsim/explicitsim/src/c6109a36474d539e27fefb0bef390d596d7aac51/INSTALL.md), and [3DSIFT-Rank](https://github.com/3dsift-rank/3DSIFT-Rank/tree/Appearance%2BGeometry). Thus, **any errors during installation should first be debugged by reading the main documentation and/or repositories of each of these software**.

### 1. Download the ReMIND and UPENN-GBM datasets:
- Follow the instructions and download the [ReMIND](https://doi.org/10.7937/3RAG-D070) dataset from [here](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/remind/).
- Do the same for the [UPENN-GBM](https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.709X-DN49) dataset from [here](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/upenn-gbm/).

ReMIND images and segmentations were downloaded in the DICOM and NRRD formats, respectively. UPENN-GBM images and segmentations were both downloaded in the NIFTI format.

This repository utilizes the ReMIND and UPENN-GBM data as is; thus, it is expected that the inner directory structures remain unaltered after downloading.

**Below you will find each dataset directory structure as is when downloaded into a `data/` directory and the subdirectories whose absolute paths will later be required as input for the first proper step of the work pipeline:**

### 1.1. ReMIND directory structures
Images and segmentations in DICOM format:
```bash
data/
|-- ReMIND/
|   |-- manifest-1746853315606/
|   |   |-- ReMIND/ # you will need the path to this directory!
|   |   |   |-- ReMIND-001/

```

Segmentations in NRRD format:

|   |   |   |   |-- ...
```

### 2. Set up [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) with the required extension:
This work requires 3D Slicer (a free, open-source image computing platform) for some tasks, including the manipulation of segmentation and image volumes, the generation of surface models, and the computation of transforms by a multi-level BSpline interpolation algorithm ([ScatteredTransform](https://github.com/grandwork2/ScatteredTransform)).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.1.** Install dependencies:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git build-essential \
  cmake cmake-curses-gui cmake-qt-gui \
  libqt5x11extras5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtwebengine5-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev qttools5-dev qtbase5-private-dev qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.2.** Build 3D Slicer from source by following the instructions from [here](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/build_instructions/linux.html#checkout-slicer-source-files). This may take up to several hours.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.3.** Clone the ScatteredTransform extension repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/grandwork2/ScatteredTransform.git
``` 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.4.** Build the extension by following the instructions [here](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/extensions.html#build-an-extension).

### 3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/venv.html), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), or other):
```
python3 -m venv .tiagoenv
source .tiagoenv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/tiago-assis/TiagoThesisWork.git
```

### 5. Install the required packages:
```
cd TiagoThesisWork/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Follow the `README.md` instructions inside each numerically-ordered folder.
This work follows a very specific pipeline that must be carefully set up and run sequentially. The `README.md` instructions present in the subdirectories of this repository should be read to achieve a high chance of success at reproducing the results. 

The main scripts run the code in batch, i.e., for every patient case inside a specified input directory.

These tutorials assume that all the previous steps have been followed, the correct environment is active, and the user is starting in the main directory of the repository.
